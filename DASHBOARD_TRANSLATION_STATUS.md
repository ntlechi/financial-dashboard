## 🔍 STILL NEEDS TRANSLATION

### **Small Text in App.js:**

Based on grep analysis, these texts appear in dashboard cards:

**1. Time/Duration Text:**
- ✅ "y" (years) - appears in: `{yearsToGoal}y {remainingMonths}m`
- ✅ "m" (months) - appears in: `{yearsToGoal}y {remainingMonths}m`
- ❌ "to goal" - appears in: `{yearsToGoal}y {remainingMonths}m to goal`
- ❌ "months total" - appears in: `({totalMonths} months total)`

**2. Progress/Goal Text:**
- ❌ "remaining" - appears in multiple cards
- ❌ "Goal achieved!" - in goals display
- ❌ "Complete!" - in progress indicators
- ❌ "room remaining" - in budget displays

**3. Financial Terms:**
- ❌ "Annual Dividends" - in investment card
- ❌ "per year" - in various calculations

**Location:** These are likely in the main `App.js` file in dashboard card rendering sections.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### **Option A: Quick Fix (30 mins)**
Focus only on the most visible text:
- "to goal"
- "remaining"
- "Goal achieved!"
- "Complete!"

### **Option B: Thorough Fix (1-2 hours)**
Review entire App.js dashboard section line by line:
- Extract all hardcoded English strings
- Add translation keys to fr.json
- Replace with t() calls
- Test each card in French

**I recommend Option B** - Let's do it right!

## 🔧 HOW TO PROCEED

### **Step 1: Identify Exact Locations**
```bash
# Find all English text in dashboard cards
grep -n "remaining\|to goal\|achieved\|Complete" src/App.js
```

### **Step 2: Add Translation Keys**
Add to `fr.json`:
```json
"dashboard": {
  ...existing keys...
  "toGoal": "jusqu'à l'objectif",
  "remaining": "restant",
  "goalAchieved": "Objectif atteint!",
  "complete": "Terminé!",
  "roomRemaining": "disponible",
  "monthsTotal": "mois au total",
  "years": "a",  // short for "ans"
  "months": "m",  // short for "mois"
  "perYear": "par an",
  "annualDividends": "Dividendes Annuels"
}
```

### **Step 3: Replace in App.js**
Use `useTranslation` hook (already imported):
```javascript
const { t } = useTranslation();

// Before:
{yearsToGoal}y {remainingMonths}m to goal

// After:
{yearsToGoal}{t('dashboard.years')} {remainingMonths}{t('dashboard.months')} {t('dashboard.toGoal')}
```
