      "q1": "What is Kompul?",
      "a1": "Kompul is your personal financial navigation system designed to guide you toward complete financial freedom. Unlike other apps that just track spending, we focus on building wealth through strategic planning, side hustle tracking, and investment management. Think of it as your financial GPS - showing you exactly where you are and the fastest route to where you want to be.",
      "q2": "Why manual entry instead of bank connections?",
      "a2": "Manual entry is intentional and powerful. When you manually enter transactions, you become more aware of your spending patterns and financial decisions. This mindful approach leads to better financial habits. Plus, manual entry means maximum privacy - your bank credentials never leave your device, and you have complete control over what data is shared.",
      "q3": "How do I get started with the free Recon Kit?",
      "a3": "Getting started is simple: 1) Create your account, 2) Add your current financial snapshot (income, expenses, assets, debts), 3) Set your first financial goal, 4) Start tracking daily transactions. The app will immediately show your net worth, cash flow, and savings rate. Most users see their complete financial picture within 10 minutes.",
      "q4": "Is my financial data secure?",
      "a4": "Absolutely. Your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using bank-level security. We use Firebase (Google Cloud) infrastructure with strict access controls. Only you can access your financial information - not even our team can see your personal data. Your privacy and security are our top priorities.",
      "q5": "Can I use this if I'm not tech-savvy?",
      "a5": "Yes! Kompul is designed for everyone, regardless of technical experience. The interface is intuitive, with clear labels and helpful tooltips. If you can use a smartphone, you can master this app. Plus, our FAQ system and support team are here to help you succeed."

      "q1": "What are the different pricing tiers?",
      "a1": "We have 3 main tiers: 1) Recon Kit \"The Recruit\" (Free Forever) - Basic dashboard with 5 essential cards (Net Worth, Cash Flow, Savings Rate, Monthly Income, Monthly Expenses), Budget Calculator, and Transaction Management, 2) Climber Plan \"The Climber\" ($7.99 USD/mo or $79 USD/year) - Full advanced dashboard with all cards, financial calculators, debt payoff, retirement planning, and goal tracking, 3) Operator Plan \"The Operator\" ($14.99 USD/mo or $149 USD/year) - Everything in Climber PLUS side hustle management, investment portfolio, and travel mode. Plus our limited Founder's Circle offer ($7.49 USD/mo for full Operator access) for the first 100 members.",
      "q2": "Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime?",
      "a2": "Yes, you can change your plan anytime. Upgrades take effect immediately with prorated billing. Downgrades take effect at your next billing cycle, so you keep full access until then. No long-term contracts or cancellation fees. Annual plans save you 17% (equivalent to 2 months free).",
      "q3": "Why these specific price points?",
      "a3": "Our pricing reflects the value delivered at each level. The Recon Kit is free because everyone deserves basic financial tools. Climber ($7.99) provides advanced analytics that replace expensive financial advisors. Operator ($14.99) includes business tools that typically cost $100+ elsewhere. Founder's Circle ($7.49) gives you full Operator features at half price - our way of rewarding early supporters.",
      "q4": "Is there a money-back guarantee?",
      "a4": "Yes! All paid plans (Climber, Operator, and Founder's Circle) come with a 30-Day, No-Questions-Asked Money-Back Guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied within 30 days, we'll refund your payment in full. You can also cancel anytime and keep access until your billing period ends."

      "q1": "What is The Founder's Circle?",
      "a1": "The Founder's Circle is an exclusive group of our first 100 users who get full Operator-level features ($14.99 USD value) for just $7.49 USD/month. This price is locked in for life as long as your subscription remains active. Founders get lifetime priority support, early access to new features, and an exclusive Founder badge.",
      "q2": "How many Founder spots are left?",
      "a2": "Founder spots are limited to exactly 100 members. The offer ends when either: 1) All 100 spots are claimed, OR 2) 7 days after our official launch (October 19, 2025, 9:00 AM EDT) - whichever comes first. Once the offer ends, it disappears forever and will never be available again.",
      "q3": "What happens if I cancel my Founder membership?",
      "a3": "If you cancel, you lose your Founder status forever - these spots will never be offered again. You can rejoin at regular pricing, but you won't get the Founder benefits, pricing, or badge back. That's why this decision is so important for early supporters."

      "a1": "Our Budget Calculator includes multiple methodologies: 50/30/20 rule (needs/wants/savings) and 6 Jars system (financial/education/play/etc.) - both available on the FREE tier! Climber and Operator tiers also unlock the Financial Freedom Calculator and Debt Payoff Calculator for advanced planning. It automatically calculates your savings rate, shows spending patterns, and suggests optimizations based on your goals.",
      "q2": "How does the Side Hustle tracker work?",
      "a2": "The Side Hustle tracker separates your business income and expenses from personal finances. It calculates profit margins, tracks tax-deductible expenses, estimates quarterly taxes, and shows your side hustle's contribution to your overall financial freedom timeline.",
      "q3": "What investment features are included?",
      "a3": "Investment tracking includes portfolio performance, dividend tracking, DRIP calculations, asset allocation analysis, and projected growth scenarios. You can track stocks, ETFs, crypto, real estate, and alternative investments all in one place.",
      "q4": "Can I track multiple currencies?",
      "a4": "Currently, the app works best with a single primary currency (USD, CAD, EUR, etc.). Multi-currency support is on our roadmap for future updates, especially for users with international investments or income sources."

      "q1": "What is a stock ticker symbol?",
      "a1": "A stock ticker is a unique code that identifies a publicly traded company (e.g., AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla). Think of it like a company's nickname on the stock market. You can find ticker symbols on Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or your broker's app. Just search for the company name!",
      "q2": "How many shares should I buy?",
      "a2": "Start with what you can afford! Even 1 share makes you a part-owner of the company. Many beginners start with 1-5 shares to learn without risking too much. As you gain confidence and income, you can buy more. Remember: It's better to own 1 share of a good company than 0 shares of any company. Start small, learn as you go!",
      "q3": "What is Average Cost and why does it matter?",
      "a3": "Average Cost is the average price you paid per share. If you bought 5 shares at $100 and 5 shares at $120, your average cost is $110. This matters because your profit/loss is calculated from this number: if the stock is at $150, you're up $40 per share ($150 - $110). If you buy at multiple times, calculate: Total Money Spent √∑ Total Shares = Average Cost.",
      "q4": "What does DRIP mean and should I use it?",
      "a4": "DRIP = Dividend Reinvestment Plan. When a company pays you dividends (like rent from your investment), DRIP automatically uses that money to buy more shares instead of giving you cash. Why use it? It compounds your wealth faster! Example: You own 10 shares ‚Üí earn $50 dividend ‚Üí DRIP buys 1 more share ‚Üí now you own 11 shares ‚Üí next dividend is bigger! It's wealth on autopilot. Highly recommended for long-term investors!",
      "q5": "What are dividends and how do they work?",
      "a5": "Dividends are cash payments companies give to shareholders - like rent from owning property! Example: You own 10 shares of a stock paying $2/share annually. You'll receive $20 per year in dividends. Some companies pay quarterly (every 3 months), others monthly. Dividend Yield shows this as a percentage (e.g., 3% yield means you earn $3 for every $100 invested). This is PASSIVE INCOME!",
      "q6": "What's the difference between Realized and Unrealized Gains?",
      "a6": "Unrealized Gain = Profit \"on paper\" (you haven't sold yet). Example: You bought at $100, stock is now $150 - you have $50 unrealized gain. Realized Gain = Profit you actually locked in by selling. If you sell those shares at $150, that $50 becomes a realized gain. Important: You only pay taxes on REALIZED gains (when you sell), not unrealized gains. Until you sell, it's just potential profit!",
      "q7": "What account type should I choose (TFSA vs RRSP)?",
      "a7": "TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) = Contributions use after-tax money, but ALL gains are tax-free forever. Perfect for: Short-mid term goals, flexible withdrawals. RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) = Contributions are tax-deductible now, but you pay tax when withdrawing. Perfect for: Retirement savings, reducing current taxes. Simple rule: Use TFSA if you want flexibility, RRSP if you want tax deductions now. Many investors use both!",
      "q8": "How do I find the current price of a stock?",
      "a8": "Easy! Go to Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com), Google Finance, or your broker's app. Type the ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL) and you'll see the current price. Prices update throughout the trading day (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST, Monday-Friday). You can also just Google \"AAPL stock price\" and it shows right in search results!",
      "q9": "I'm completely new - where do I start?",
      "a9": "Start here: 1) Learn the basics (you're doing it now!), 2) Open a brokerage account (Wealthsimple, Questrade, etc. in Canada), 3) Start with 1 share of a company you know (Apple, Microsoft, etc.), 4) Add it to this app and watch it grow!, 5) Learn as you go - each investment teaches you something new. Remember: Every expert investor started exactly where you are now. You've got this! üí™"
