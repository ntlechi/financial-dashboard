### **1. Make It a Habit**

**Morning:** Right after your trading session  
**Evening:** Before dinner or before bed  

**Consistency > Perfection**

---

### **2. Start Small**

Don't fill in EVERYTHING at first. Start with:
- ✅ Today's 3 focus tasks (morning)
- ✅ Wins (evening)
- ✅ Tomorrow's top 3 (evening)

Add more sections as the habit sticks.

---

### **3. Be Honest**

This is for YOU, not for show:
- Bad days are okay to document
- Low energy is normal
- Challenges teach you patterns
- Be real about what's working and what's not

---

### **4. Review Regularly**

The REAL value is in the reviews:
- **Weekly:** See patterns
- **Monthly:** Track growth
- **Quarterly:** Big picture progress

**If you don't review, it's just busy work.**  
**If you DO review, it's a growth machine.** 🚀

---

### **5. Customize**

This template is a starting point. Adjust:
- Remove sections you don't need
- Add sections for your specific goals
- Change metrics to track what matters to YOU
- Make it YOUR system

---
