## Bi-Weekly + Day-of-Week Selection Feature

**User Request:** "My job pays bi-weekly every Thursday. Need this!"  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IMPLEMENTING NOW!  
**Impact:** Major UX improvement for recurring income!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **THE FEATURE:**

### **Current System (Limited):**
```
Frequency options:
- Monthly only
- Date-based only

Problem:
- Can't do "bi-weekly"
- Can't do "every Thursday"
- Doesn't match real paycheck schedules!
```

### **Enhanced System (Requested):**
```
Frequency options:
- Weekly
- Bi-weekly
- Monthly

Day-of-week selection:
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

Examples:
- "Bi-weekly, every Thursday" (paychecks!)
- "Weekly, every Monday" (side hustle payment)
- "Monthly, 1st of month" (rent)
```

---

## ðŸ”§ **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

### **Step 1: Update Data Structure**
```javascript
recurringItem: {
  description: "9-to-5 Paycheck",
  amount: 2500,
  frequency: "bi-weekly", // weekly, bi-weekly, monthly
  dayOfWeek: 4, // 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 4=Thursday
  isPassive: false,
  category: "employment",
  nextDueDate: "2025-10-17" // Next Thursday
}
```

### **Step 2: Add UI for Day-of-Week**
```javascript
<select value={frequency}>
  <option value="weekly">Weekly</option>
  <option value="bi-weekly">Bi-weekly</option>
  <option value="monthly">Monthly</option>
</select>

{frequency !== 'monthly' && (
  <select value={dayOfWeek}>
    <option value={0}>Sunday</option>
    <option value={1}>Monday</option>
    <option value={2}>Tuesday</option>
    <option value={3}>Wednesday</option>
    <option value={4}>Thursday</option>
    <option value={5}>Friday</option>
    <option value={6}>Saturday</option>
  </select>
)}

{frequency === 'monthly' && (
  <input type="number" min="1" max="31" placeholder="Day of month"/>
)}
```

### **Step 3: Calculate Next Due Date**
```javascript
function calculateNextDueDate(frequency, dayOfWeek, lastProcessed) {
  const today = new Date();
  
  if (frequency === 'weekly') {
    // Find next occurrence of dayOfWeek
    const daysUntilNext = (dayOfWeek - today.getDay() + 7) % 7;
    const nextDate = new Date(today);
    nextDate.setDate(today.getDate() + (daysUntilNext || 7));
    return nextDate;
  }
  
  if (frequency === 'bi-weekly') {
    // Find next occurrence, but skip 1 week
    const lastDate = new Date(lastProcessed);
    lastDate.setDate(lastDate.getDate() + 14); // Add 2 weeks
    return lastDate;
  }
  
  if (frequency === 'monthly') {
    // Existing monthly logic
    const nextMonth = new Date(today);
    nextMonth.setMonth(today.getMonth() + 1);
    return nextMonth;
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Auto-Process on Due Date**
```javascript
// Check daily if recurring items are due
if (today >= nextDueDate) {
  // Add to Recent Transactions automatically!
  const transaction = {
    id: Date.now(),
    description: recurring.description,
    amount: recurring.amount,
    date: today,
    category: recurring.category,
    isRecurring: true,
    recurringId: recurring.id
  };
  
  // Add to transactions
  // Update nextDueDate
}
```
