---

## ⚠️ PENDING TASKS (PRIORITY ORDER):

### **IMMEDIATE (Before Launch):**

#### 1. **Add Google Analytics Measurement ID** ⏰ **CRITICAL**
**File:** `public/index.html`  
**What to do:**
1. Get GA4 Measurement ID from https://analytics.google.com/
2. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` in 2 places (lines 23 & 30)
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Verify tracking works in GA4 Realtime report

**Why it's critical:** Without this, we have NO analytics on launch day!

#### 2. **Final Pre-Launch Testing** 🧪
**Test these critical flows:**
- [ ] Sign up → Upgrade to Climber → Verify features unlock
- [ ] Add transaction → Check monthly income/expense calculations
- [ ] Reset to sample data → Verify realistic numbers
- [ ] Submit bug report via feedback button → Check Firebase
- [ ] Submit feature request → Check Firebase
- [ ] Test on mobile (especially feedback modal + all new features)

#### 3. **French Waiting List (Optional)** 🇫🇷
User wants to create a French waiting list for November.
**NOT required for October 19th launch** - English-only for now.
**If user asks:** This is Phase 2 (November).

---

## 🔧 KNOWN ISSUES / EDGE CASES:

### **All Fixed! No Known Bugs** ✅
The app is in excellent shape. All recent bugs have been resolved:
- ✅ Monthly income/expenses now accurate
- ✅ Net Worth card doesn't error
- ✅ Sample data is realistic
- ✅ Side Hustle items are editable
- ✅ Feedback system working

**To Deploy:**

## 📊 ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTATION:

**What's Tracked:**
- ✅ Page views (which tabs users visit)
- ✅ Locked feature clicks (which premium features are desired)
- ✅ Feedback submissions (bug reports & feature requests)
- ✅ Real-time users
- ✅ User demographics
- ✅ Device breakdown

**How to Track More Events:**
```javascript
trackEvent('event_name', {
  param1: 'value1',
  param2: 'value2'
});
```

The `trackEvent` function is already implemented in `src/App.js` (line ~8665).

---

## 💬 FEEDBACK SYSTEM:

**How It Works:**
1. User clicks floating button (bottom-right)
2. Modal opens with bug/feature toggle
3. User enters description + email
4. Saves to Firebase `feedback` collection
5. Tracks event in Google Analytics

**To View Feedback:**
Firebase Console → Firestore Database → `feedback` collection

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  type: "bug" | "feature",
  message: "User's description",
  email: "user@example.com",
  userPlan: "FREE" | "CLIMBER" | "OPERATOR",
  page: "dashboard" | "transactions" | etc.,
  url: "https://...",
  timestamp: "2025-10-06T...",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0..."
}
```
