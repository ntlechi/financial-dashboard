## 🛠️ **Technical Improvements Made:**

### **Authentication System:**
```javascript
// Before: Mock authentication
const [user, setUser] = useState({ uid: 'dev-user', email: 'dev@test.com' });

// After: Real Firebase authentication
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
// + Anonymous auth for immediate access
// + Proper user session management
```

### **Data Persistence:**
```javascript
// Before: Skipped Firebase operations
if (userId && userId !== 'dev-user') {
  // Save to Firebase
}

// After: Real-time Firebase integration
if (userId && auth.currentUser) {
  // Save to Firebase with proper user isolation
}
```

### **Environment Configuration:**
- **✅ Created `.env` template** with all required variables
- **✅ Added environment validation** with helpful error messages
- **✅ Security configuration** for production deployment
