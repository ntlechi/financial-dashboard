Value: # Why 3 Months?

When I was broke at 30, I had zero runway. One missed paycheck = disaster.

**The 3-month rule saved my life:**
- Covers unexpected job loss
- Gives you breathing room to think
- Breaks the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle

## How to Build It:

1. **Calculate monthly expenses**: Add up rent, food, bills
2. **Multiply by 3**: This is your target
3. **Start small**: Even $500 is progress
4. **Automate savings**: Set up automatic transfer

## Why It Works:

This isn't about getting rich. It's about buying your freedom to make better decisions.

When you have 3 months saved, you can:
- Negotiate better at work
- Walk away from toxic situations
- Think clearly instead of panic

**This is your foundation. Everything else builds on this.**

(You can use Markdown: # for headers, ** for bold, - for bullets, etc.)
