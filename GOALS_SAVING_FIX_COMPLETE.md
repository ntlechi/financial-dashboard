## ✅ GOALS NOW SAVE PROPERLY!

Fixed **TWO critical bugs** preventing goals from saving!

---

## 🐛 BUG #1: Array Treated as Object

### **The Problem:**
The `saveCardData` function was treating the goals **array** as an **object**, which broke the save!

**BAD CODE:**
```javascript
// This converted the array to an object!
const convertedData = {};
Object.keys(tempCardData).forEach(key => {
  // For an array, keys are "0", "1", "2"
  // This turned [goal1, goal2] into {0: goal1, 1: goal2}
  convertedData[key] = value;
});

// Then saved as: data.goals = {0: goal1, 1: goal2}
// Instead of: data.goals = [goal1, goal2]
```

**Result:** Goals were saved as an object with numeric keys, not an array! ❌

---

### **The Fix:**

**GOOD CODE:**
```javascript
let convertedData;

// 🎯 Special handling for array-based cards
if (Array.isArray(tempCardData)) {
  // Keep it as an array!
  convertedData = tempCardData.map(item => {
    // Convert strings to numbers within each goal
    const converted = {};
    Object.keys(item).forEach(key => {
      const value = item[key];
      if (typeof value === 'string' && !isNaN(value)) {
        converted[key] = Number(value);
      } else {
        converted[key] = value;
      }
    });
    return converted;
  });
} else {
  // Original object handling...
}
```

**Result:** Goals are now saved as an array! ✅

---

## 🐛 BUG #2: Wrong Field Name

### **The Problem:**
New goals were created with `deadline` but the card expects `targetDate`!

**BAD CODE:**
```javascript
const newGoal = {
  id: Date.now(),
  name: '',
  targetAmount: 0,
  currentAmount: 0,
  deadline: '2025-12-31' // ← Wrong field name!
};
```

**In GoalsCard:**
```javascript
{goal.targetDate && ( // ← Looking for targetDate!
  <div>Target: {goal.targetDate}</div>
)}
```

**Result:** Target dates never showed up! ❌

---

### **The Fix:**

**GOOD CODE:**
```javascript
const newGoal = {
  id: Date.now(),
  name: '',
  targetAmount: 0,
  currentAmount: 0,
  targetDate: '2025-12-31' // ← Correct field name!
};
```

**Result:** Target dates now show properly! ✅
