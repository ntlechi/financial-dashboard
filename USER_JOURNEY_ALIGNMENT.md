## 🚨 **Critical Gaps We Need to Address**

### **1. Authentication Flow Mismatch** ⚠️
**Current State:**
- App uses **anonymous authentication** (auto sign-in)
- No email/password or Google sign-in integration

**Required for User Journey:**
- **Email/Password authentication**
- **"Continue with Google" option**
- **Account creation flow** that integrates with Stripe

**Impact:** Users can't create proper accounts that link to their Founder's Circle purchase

### **2. Stripe Integration Missing** ⚠️
**Current State:**
- No Stripe checkout integration
- No subscription management
- No "Operator" status handling

**Required for User Journey:**
- **Stripe checkout integration** for Founder's Circle ($7.49/mo)
- **Account upgrade to "Operator" status** after payment
- **"Founder" role flagging** in user profiles

**Impact:** No way to convert visitors to paying Founder's Circle members

### **3. User Role Management Missing** ⚠️
**Current State:**
- All users have same access level
- No differentiation between free/paid users

**Required for User Journey:**
- **User roles:** Free, Recon, Climber, Operator, Founder
- **Feature gating** based on subscription level
- **Founder's Circle exclusive features**

**Impact:** Can't provide differentiated experience for paying members
