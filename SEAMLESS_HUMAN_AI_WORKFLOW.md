## 🤝 OUR PARTNERSHIP PRINCIPLES

### **1. YOU = Vision & Direction**

**Your Role:**
- Set strategic direction
- Make final decisions
- Provide business context
- Define user experience
- Approve designs/features

**Example:**
```
You: "I want users to feel empowered, not overwhelmed.
     Let's make the receipt scanner feel magical, not technical."

Me: "Got it! I'll design the UI to hide complexity,
    show progress clearly, and celebrate success.
    Here's my approach..."
```

---

### **2. ME = Execution & Optimization**

**My Role:**
- Implement your vision
- Handle technical details
- Optimize performance
- Catch bugs/issues
- Suggest improvements

**Example:**
```
You: "Build the receipt scanner"

Me: "I'll build:
    1. Photo upload with compression
    2. OCR integration
    3. Auto-fill expense form
    4. Error handling
    5. Loading states
    
    And I'll make sure it's:
    - Fast (1-2 second uploads)
    - Reliable (error recovery)
    - Beautiful (smooth animations)
    - Bilingual (English + French)"
```

---

### **3. WE = Continuous Feedback Loop**

└────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Me: Propose solution + reasoning   │

└────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You: Test and give feedback        │
└────────────────┬────────────────────┘

## 💡 COMMUNICATION BEST PRACTICES

### **When Asking Me for Help:**

**❌ DON'T:**
```
"Fix the thing"
(Too vague - I don't know what needs fixing)
```

**✅ DO:**
```
"The receipt upload button isn't working.
When I click it, nothing happens.
Here's the error in console: [ERROR]
Can you help me fix this?"

(Specific, includes context, shows me the error)
```

---

**❌ DON'T:**
```
"Build the whole feature"
(Too broad - need to break it down)
```

**✅ DO:**
```
"Let's build receipt scanner. Today I want to start with
just the photo upload button. Let's get that working first,
then we'll add OCR tomorrow. Sound good?"

(Specific, breaks into steps, sets expectations)
```

---

**❌ DON'T:**
```
"Why isn't this working???" [Frustrated]
(I'm here to help! Stay calm, we'll fix it together)
```

**✅ DO:**
```
"Hey Claude, I'm stuck on this. I've tried X and Y,
but still not working. Can you take a look?"

(Calm, shows what you tried, asks for partnership)
```

---

### **When I Suggest Something:**

**I'll always explain WHY:**
```
Me: "I recommend building French i18n FIRST because:
    1. [TECHNICAL REASON]
    2. [EFFICIENCY REASON]
    3. [STRATEGIC REASON]
    
    But if you prefer features first, here's how we'd do that:
    [ALTERNATIVE APPROACH]
    
    Your call - what makes more sense to you?"
```

**YOU decide:**
- If my reasoning makes sense → Go with my suggestion
- If you have a better idea → Share it, I'll adapt!
- If you're unsure → Ask questions, I'll explain more!

**No wrong questions, no bad ideas - we're partners!** 🤝
