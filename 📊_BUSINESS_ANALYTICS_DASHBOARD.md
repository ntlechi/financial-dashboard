```javascript
Transactions:
- 2024-03-15: +$500 (income)
- 2024-03-20: +$800 (income)
- 2024-03-10: -$100 (expense)

↓ Process ↓

Filter: "Last 12 Months"
                    ↓
Filtered: [April 2024, May 2024, ..., March 2025]
```

**Step 3: Calculate KPIs**
```javascript
Total Revenue = Sum of all income
Total Expenses = Sum of all expenses
Total Profit = Revenue - Expenses
Growth % = (Current - Previous) / Previous * 100
```

**Step 4: YoY Comparison**
```javascript

Calculate: Growth % for each metric
Generate: Smart insight based on performance
