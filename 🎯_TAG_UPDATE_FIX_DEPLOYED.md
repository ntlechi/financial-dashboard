# 🎯 TAG UPDATE FIX DEPLOYED - October 20, 2025

## ✅ ISSUE FIXED!

**Problem:** When FREE users upgraded to PAID, ConvertKit tag didn't update  
**Cause:** `payment_succeeded` email trigger wasn't passing subscription tier  
**Fix:** Now passes `subscriptionTier`, `planName`, and `productName` to email handler  
**Status:** 🚀 **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**

---

## 🔍 WHAT WAS HAPPENING:

### **Before Fix:**
```
User Flow:
1. User signs up FREE → ConvertKit tag: "Status - Recruit (Free)" ✅
2. User upgrades to Founder's Circle → Payment processes ✅
3. Firebase tier updated → "founders-circle" ✅
4. ConvertKit tag → STILL "Status - Recruit (Free)" ❌
```

**Why:** The `payment_succeeded` webhook didn't pass subscription tier to ConvertKit!

### **After Fix:**
```
User Flow:
1. User signs up FREE → ConvertKit tag: "Status - Recruit (Free)" ✅
2. User upgrades to Founder's Circle → Payment processes ✅
3. Firebase tier updated → "founders-circle" ✅  
4. ConvertKit tag → UPDATED to "Status - Founder" ✅
```

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS CHANGED:

**File:** `api/stripe-webhook.js`

### **Change 1: Main Payment Handler (Line 843-856)**

**Before:**
```javascript
await sendEmail(userId, 'payment_succeeded');
// ❌ No tier info passed!
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Get subscription tier from price ID
const priceId = subscription.items.data[0]?.price.id;
const subscriptionTier = PLAN_MAPPING[priceId] || 'founders-circle';
const productName = getProductNameFromTier(subscriptionTier);

// Send payment success email with subscription tier for ConvertKit tagging
await sendEmail(userId, 'payment_succeeded', {
  subscriptionTier,  // ← NOW PASSED!
  planName: getProductNameFromTier(subscriptionTier),
  productName: productName
});
```

### **Change 2: Fallback Handler (Line 828)**

Same fix applied to the fallback path for users found by email.

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST:

### **Wait ~2 minutes for Vercel deployment, then:**

### **Option 1: Resend Webhook (Easiest)**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Find `invoice.payment_succeeded` event from your test
3. Click "Resend webhook"

### **Option 2: New Test**
1. Create another FREE account
2. Upgrade to Founder's Circle
3. Check ConvertKit

---

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS:

### **When you resend the webhook:**

**Vercel Logs should show:**
```
✅ Payment succeeded for user [userId]
🔍 Checking if subscriber already exists...
✅ Subscriber already exists with ID: [number]
🏷️ Adding tag to subscriber
✅ Found tag ID for: Status - Founder
✅ ConvertKit tag added
```

**ConvertKit should show:**
```
Subscriber: hugofortune.t01@outlook.com
Tags: 
  - Status - Recruit (Free) ← OLD (might stay)
  - Status - Founder ← NEW! ✅
```

**Note:** The code adds the new tag but doesn't remove the old one. This is actually fine - you can have multiple tags. But if you want to remove the old tag, you can do it manually in ConvertKit or we can add code to remove it.

---

## 🎯 TAG BEHAVIOR:

### **Current Behavior:**
- ✅ Adds new tag ("Status - Founder")
- ⚠️ Keeps old tag ("Status - Recruit (Free)")

**This is fine because:**
- Automations trigger on tag added (not tag changed)
- You can filter by most recent tag
- Keeps history of user journey

### **If You Want Auto-Remove Old Tag:**
We can add code to:
1. Check existing tags
2. Remove old tier tags
3. Add new tier tag

Let me know if you want this!
