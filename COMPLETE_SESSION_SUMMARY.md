- **Obvious reason to upgrade!**

### **Conversion Psychology:**
1. **Awareness:** FREE user tracks expenses
2. **Interest:** Sees locked Mission Control
3. **Desire:** Reads benefits (North Star, Why, Projected Date)
4. **Action:** "I need this!" → Upgrades to Climber
5. **Retention:** Uses Mission Control daily → Stays subscribed
