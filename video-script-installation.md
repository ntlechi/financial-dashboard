"Hey, it's [Your Name]. People keep asking me how to install the Survive Backpacking app. It's actually super easy - takes less than 60 seconds. Let me show you exactly how to do it on any device."

## IPHONE DEMO (0:15-1:00)
**[Screen: iPhone screen recording]**

"First, iPhone users. Open Safari - and this is important, it has to be Safari, not Chrome or any other browser. 

Now go to survivebackpacking.com... 

See this share button at the bottom? The square with the arrow? Tap that.

Now scroll down and you'll see 'Add to Home Screen' - tap that.

You can change the name if you want, but I'll just tap 'Add' in the top right.

And boom! There's the app icon on my home screen. Tap it and it opens just like any other app."

## ANDROID DEMO (1:00-1:45)
**[Screen: Android screen recording]**

"For Android users, open Chrome browser. Go to the same website - survivebackpacking.com.

Now look for these three dots in the top right corner. Tap that.

You'll see 'Add to Home screen' - tap that.

Hit 'Add' and just like that, the app is installed on your Android device."

## DESKTOP DEMO (1:45-2:15)
**[Screen: Desktop screen recording]**

"Desktop users, this is even easier. Just go to the website in Chrome or Edge.

See this little computer icon in the address bar? Click that.

Click 'Install' and the app opens in its own window. You can use it just like any other desktop application."

## BENEFITS (2:15-2:45)
**[Screen: App features montage]**

"Why install it as an app? Well, you get instant access from your home screen, it works offline when you need it, and it feels just like a native app - but without the app store hassles or fees.

Plus, you'll get notified of important updates and new features as I add them."

## OUTRO (2:45-3:00)
**[Screen: You speaking to camera]**

"That's it! Super simple, works on every device, no app store required. If you run into any issues, drop a comment below or email me directly. Now go install it and start taking control of your finances.

And remember - this app was built by someone who's been broke, for people who refuse to stay that way. Let's build back stronger together."
