# **OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT**

## **What We Can Access (Technical Truth):**

As the platform administrator, I have technical access to the database where your data is stored. This is standard for any app or service—someone needs to maintain the system, fix bugs, and provide support.

**However, here's what I promise:**

---

## **What We Will NEVER Do:**

❌ Browse your data out of curiosity  
❌ Sell your data to advertisers or third parties  
❌ Share your financial information with anyone

## **When We WILL Access Your Data:**

We will ONLY access your data in these specific situations:

   - Example: "I can't see my goals. Can you help?"
   - We'll look at the specific issue you reported to fix it.

✅ **You Report a Bug**  
   - Example: "App crashes when I add a transaction."
   - We'll check your data to reproduce and fix the bug.

✅ **You Request Data Export**  
   - Example: "Can I download all my data?"
   - We'll access your account to fulfill your request.

   - We'll verify everything is deleted completely.

## **The Honest Truth:**

I built this app because I was broke and needed a system to get free.

I know what it's like to be vulnerable with your finances.

I know the fear of sharing your struggles.

I know the shame of debt and the hope of progress.

**I will NEVER betray that trust.**

Yes, I CAN technically access your data (like any platform admin).

But I will ONLY access it:
- When YOU ask for help
- To fix bugs YOU report
- To fulfill YOUR requests

**Your data is YOUR story. I'm just helping you tell it.**
