# 🧪 FREE TIER TEST - Verify Goals + Runway Visible

**Issue:** Goals card not showing for free tier  
**Your Setup:** Testing with Recon tier  
**Console Shows:** "operator" (might be caching issue!)

---

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Verify Your Account Tier**
```
Open Console (F12)
Look for: "✅ Active subscription found: operator"

If it says "operator" → You're NOT on free tier!
You're testing with Operator account!

Free tier should say:
"📋 No active subscription, using free tier"
OR
"📋 No user document, using free tier"
```

### **Step 2: Test with ACTUAL Free Account**
```
Option A: Incognito Window
1. Open Incognito/Private window
2. Go to app
3. Sign up with NEW email (test123@test.com)
4. DON'T subscribe to anything
5. Check dashboard

Should see:
✅ Survival Runway card
✅ Financial Goals card (0/3 goals)

Option B: Sign Out Current Account
1. Sign out
2. Create new account
3. Stay on free tier
4. Check dashboard
```

### **Step 3: Hard Refresh (Cache Issue)**
```
If you want to test current account:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. This clears cache and reloads fresh
3. Check if cards appear

OR:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

## 🐛 **POSSIBLE ISSUES:**

### **Issue #1: Testing with Operator Account**
```
Console: "operator" subscription
Reality: You have Operator access, not free!

To test free tier:
- Need actual free account
- Or downgrade current account
```

### **Issue #2: Cache/Old Version**
```
Browser cached old version with locks

Fix: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
```

### **Issue #3: Data Not Initialized**
```
If account has NO goals array:
Card might not render

Fix: Edit card, create first goal
```
