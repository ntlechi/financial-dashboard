# ‚öôÔ∏è STRIPE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST
## What You MUST Configure Before Launch

**Critical:** These settings ensure payments work and users get access!  
**Time Needed:** 30 minutes  
**When:** Before October 19 launch

---

## ‚úÖ **STEP 1: CHECKOUT REDIRECT URLS** (5 minutes)

### **Location:**
Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Checkout settings

### **Configure:**

**Success URL:**
```
https://app.survivebackpacking.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
```

**Cancel URL:**
```
https://app.survivebackpacking.com/pricing
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- After payment, user must return to YOUR app (not stuck on Stripe!)
- Success URL shows confirmation + unlocks features
- Cancel URL lets them try again if they change mind

### **Test:**
- Use Stripe test mode
- Complete checkout
- Verify redirects to your success page
- session_id should be in URL

---

## ‚úÖ **STEP 2: WEBHOOK ENDPOINT** (10 minutes)

### **Location:**
Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks

### **Add Endpoint:**
```
URL: https://app.survivebackpacking.com/api/stripe-webhook
Description: "Freedom Compass subscription updates"
```

### **Events to Listen For:**
```
‚úÖ checkout.session.completed (user paid!)
‚úÖ customer.subscription.created (subscription started)
‚úÖ customer.subscription.updated (plan changed)
‚úÖ customer.subscription.deleted (canceled)
‚úÖ invoice.payment_succeeded (monthly billing success)
‚úÖ invoice.payment_failed (payment declined)
```

### **Get Webhook Secret:**
After creating endpoint, Stripe shows:
```
Signing secret: whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**You need this for webhook verification!**

**Add to your .env file:**
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### **Test Webhook:**
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook

# Trigger test event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- Webhook updates Firebase when payment succeeds
- Without webhook, user pays but gets NO ACCESS!
- CRITICAL for payments to work!

---

## ‚úÖ **STEP 3: CUSTOMER PORTAL** (5 minutes)

### **Location:**
Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Customer portal

### **Enable Portal:**
```
‚úÖ Turn ON customer portal
```

### **Configure Allowed Actions:**
```
‚úÖ Update payment method
‚úÖ Cancel subscription
‚úÖ View invoices
‚úÖ Download receipts
‚ùå Switch plans (handle in your app)
```

### **Branding:**
```
- Upload logo
- Set brand colors
- Add support email
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- Users can self-manage subscriptions
- Reduces support burden
- Professional experience

---

## ‚úÖ **STEP 4: EMAIL CUSTOMIZATION** (10 minutes)

### **Location:**
Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Emails

### **Customize These Emails:**

**1. Subscription Confirmation:**
```
SUBJECT: "Welcome to The Founder's Circle!"

BODY (customize):
"Thanks for joining!

You're now 1 of 100 lifetime Founder's Circle members.

Your Operator Plan access is active.

Get started:

```

**2. Payment Receipt:**
```
[Use Stripe's default or customize]

Make sure it includes:
- Amount ($7.49)
- Next billing date
- Subscription details
- Receipt PDF
```

**3. Upcoming Invoice Reminder:**
```
"Your subscription renews in 3 days"
[Stripe sends this automatically]
```

**4. Payment Failed:**
```
"We couldn't process your payment"
[Critical! Make sure this is set up!]
```
