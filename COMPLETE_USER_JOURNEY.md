## 💳 **PHASE 6: STRIPE CHECKOUT**

### **What Happens (Technical Flow):**

**Step 1: Initiate Checkout**
```javascript
// In App.js or PricingModal
const handleUpgrade = async (planId) => {
  // Get Stripe price ID
  const priceId = 'price_1SEtrg82nQ0x7qb2NBJr0IVU'; // Founder's Circle
  
  // Create Stripe checkout session
  const checkoutUrl = `https://buy.stripe.com/[your-checkout-link]?
    prefilled_email=${user.email}&
    client_reference_id=${userId}`;
  
  // Redirect to Stripe
  window.location.href = checkoutUrl;
};
```

**Step 2: Stripe Hosted Checkout**
```
User is redirected to:
https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/[session_id]

STRIPE PAGE SHOWS:

- Price: $7.49/month
- Payment form (card details)

USER ENTERS:
- Card number

```

---

## ✅ **PHASE 7: POST-PAYMENT (What Happens Next)**

### **Stripe Webhook Fires:**
```javascript
// Stripe sends webhook to your server:
POST https://app.survivebackpacking.com/api/stripe-webhook

EVENT: "checkout.session.completed"
DATA: {
  customer: "cus_xxx",
  subscription: "sub_xxx",
  customer_email: "user@example.com",
  client_reference_id: "firebase_user_id",
  metadata: {
    userId: "firebase_user_id",
    plan: "founders-circle"
  }
}
```

### **Your Webhook Handler (stripe-webhook.js):**
```javascript
// File: src/api/stripe-webhook.js

1. Receives webhook
2. Verifies signature (security!)
3. Extracts userId from client_reference_id
4. Maps price ID to subscription tier:
   'price_1SEtrg82nQ0x7qb2NBJr0IVU' → FOUNDERS_CIRCLE

5. Updates Firebase:
   users/{userId}/subscription: {
     plan: 'founders-circle',
     stripeCustomerId: 'cus_xxx',
     stripeSubscriptionId: 'sub_xxx',
     status: 'active',
     currentPeriodEnd: timestamp
   }

6. Sends success response to Stripe
```

### **User's App Updates Automatically:**
```javascript
// App.js checks subscription status on load
useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch user subscription
  const subDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, `users/${userId}/subscription`));
  
  if (subDoc.exists()) {
    const subscription = subDoc.data();
    setUserPlan(subscription.plan); // 'founders-circle'
  }
}, [userId]);

// When userPlan changes:
- Dashboard unlocks Operator features
- Supply Crate System accessible
- Side Hustle visible
- Investment visible
- Travel mode visible
- "Founder's Circle" badge shows in profile
```

### **Success Page (app.survivebackpacking.com/success):**

→ Shows:
   - Current plan: Founder's Circle
   - Price: $7.49/month

```

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: WEBHOOK MUST UPDATE FIREBASE!**

### **Current Webhook Issue:**
```javascript
// In stripe-webhook.js line 73-79
const planMapping = {
  'price_climber_monthly': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.CLIMBER,
  'price_climber_annual': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.CLIMBER,
  'price_operator_monthly': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.OPERATOR,
  'price_operator_annual': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.OPERATOR,
  'price_founders_monthly': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.FOUNDERS_CIRCLE, // ❌ WRONG!
  'price_founders_annual': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.FOUNDERS_CIRCLE,
};
```

**PROBLEM:** Using placeholder price IDs, not real ones!

**FIX NEEDED:**
```javascript
const planMapping = {
  // REAL Founder's Circle price ID:
  'price_1SEtrg82nQ0x7qb2NBJr0IVU': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.FOUNDERS_CIRCLE, // ✅
  
  // REAL Early Adopter price ID:
  'price_1SH2rg82nQ0x7qb2wte7rkSV': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.EARLY_ADOPTER, // ✅
  
  // REAL Climber price IDs:
  'price_1fZu9ANe1ge3F07Q6aX7bW05': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.CLIMBER, // Monthly
  'price_19B628l8GWaRtbQyard7bW06': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.CLIMBER, // Yearly
  
  // REAL Operator price IDs:
  'price_1aFa6oB1eu6Bd2fY6aX7bW03': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.OPERATOR, // Monthly
  'price_14gM8wJ6yOcZBcUC0QD7bW04': SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.OPERATOR, // Yearly
};
```

**I'll fix this now!**
