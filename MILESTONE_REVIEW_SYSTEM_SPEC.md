```javascript
// When goal progress reaches 100%
if (currentAmount >= targetAmount && !goal.reviewMissionTriggered) {
  triggerReviewMission('goalComplete', `Goal Achieved: ${goal.name}`);
  goal.reviewMissionTriggered = true;
}
```

### **Rank-Up Check:**
```javascript
// In rank-up modal
if (newRank.name === 'Climber' && !profile.reviewMilestones.rankClimber.triggered) {
  // After rank-up modal closes, show review mission
