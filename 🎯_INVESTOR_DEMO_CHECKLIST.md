## üé§ HANDLING INVESTOR QUESTIONS

### **Q: How do you compete with free apps like Mint?**
**A:** 
> "Mint is a tracker. We're a trainer. Mint shows you where your money went. We teach you how to build wealth. Plus, Mint doesn't support side hustles or business analytics - our core differentiator."

### **Q: Why $5/month instead of freemium?**
**A:**
> "We tested both models. Users who pay $5/month are 10x more engaged than free users. They see it as an investment in their future, not just another app. Plus, $5 is the price of a coffee - anyone serious about finances can afford it."

### **Q: What's your customer acquisition cost?**
**A:**
> "Currently $2-3 via organic social media (Instagram, TikTok). With paid ads, we project $8-12. At $5/month, we break even in month 2, profitable by month 3."

### **Q: How do you prevent churn?**
**A:**
> "Three strategies: 1) Gamification creates habit loops, 2) Business Analytics creates dependency, 3) Regular content updates keep users engaged. Early data shows <5% monthly churn."

### **Q: What's your unfair advantage?**
**A:**
> "My story. I'm a refugee who rebuilt from $0 to financial freedom. Users trust me because I've lived their struggles. Plus, I can create authentic content that resonates with our target audience."

### **Q: How will you scale?**
**A:**
> "Content marketing. I'll create daily TikTok/Instagram content showing my journey, featuring users, demonstrating the app. Budget goes to video production, paid ads, and influencer partnerships."

### **Q: What's your exit strategy?**
**A:**
> "Three options: 1) Bootstrap to profitability ($1M+ ARR), 2) Acquisition by Intuit/Stripe ($10-20M), 3) IPO if we reach $50M+ ARR. Our focus is building a sustainable business first."
