## 📊 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **State Change:**
```javascript
// OLD:
const [resetToSample, setResetToSample] = useState(false); // Boolean

// NEW:
const [resetType, setResetType] = useState('financial-only'); // String
// Values: 'financial-only', 'sample-financial', 'whole-app'
```

### **Logic Flow:**
```javascript
if (resetType === 'sample-financial') {
  // Preserve: moments, logbook
  // Load: sample transactions only
  // Clear: businesses, investments, travel (FREE tier safe!)
  // Reset XP: Yes
} else if (resetType === 'financial-only') {
  // Preserve: moments, logbook, businesses, travel, investments
  // Clear: transactions, dashboard
  // Reset XP: NO! (keep rank!)
} else { // 'whole-app'
  // Delete: EVERYTHING
  // Reset XP: Yes
}
```

### **XP Reset Logic:**
```javascript
// ✅ Smart XP handling
if (resetType === 'sample-financial' || resetType === 'whole-app') {
  // Reset XP to 0
  await setDoc(doc(db, 'userProfiles', userId), initialProfile);
} else {
  // Keep current XP for financial-only reset!
}
```
