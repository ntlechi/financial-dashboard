# üö® URGENT: Stripe Price ID Fix Guide

**Problem:** The app is failing with "No such price: 'price_operator_monthly'" error because the price IDs are not properly configured.

**Error Count:** 16 failed checkout sessions in the last 7 days

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue is in `src/pricing.js` where placeholder price IDs are being used instead of actual Stripe price IDs:

```javascript
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
'operator-monthly': 'price_operator_monthly',  // ‚ùå This doesn't exist in Stripe
'climber-monthly': 'price_climber_monthly',    // ‚ùå This doesn't exist in Stripe
```

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Create Stripe Price IDs

### Step 1: Create Price IDs in Stripe Dashboard

Go to your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Create the following products and prices:

#### Climber Plan
- **Product Name:** "Climber Plan"
- **Description:** "The essential gear for the ascent"
- **Monthly Price:** $7.99/month
- **Annual Price:** $79/year

#### Operator Plan  
- **Product Name:** "Operator Plan"
- **Description:** "The full arsenal for building your empire"
- **Monthly Price:** $14.99/month
- **Annual Price:** $149/year

### Step 2: Copy the Price IDs

After creating the products, copy the price IDs (they start with `price_`) and update your environment variables.

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Stripe Price IDs - Regular Plans
REACT_APP_STRIPE_CLIMBER_MONTHLY=price_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
REACT_APP_STRIPE_CLIMBER_ANNUAL=price_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
REACT_APP_STRIPE_OPERATOR_MONTHLY=price_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
REACT_APP_STRIPE_OPERATOR_ANNUAL=price_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Step 4: Update Vercel Environment Variables

Also add these to your Vercel dashboard environment variables so they work in production.
