## 🔥 **FIX #1: STORAGE RULES (No Upgrade Needed!)**

### **Problem:**
- Firebase Storage rules required upgrade
- Video reviews = extra cost
- Not necessary for small user base

### **Solution: TEXT-ONLY REVIEWS!** ✅
```
storage.rules:
- Removed video upload requirement
- Text-only milestone reviews
- No upgrade costs!
- Can add videos later when profitable
```

### **Why Smart:**
- 💰 Saves money (startup-friendly!)
- 💡 Text reviews are enough for Phase 1
- 🚀 Can add video when user base grows
- ✅ No functionality lost

---

## 🔄 **FIX #2: BI-WEEKLY IN EDIT MODAL**

### **Problem:**
- Bi-weekly option in ADD modal ✅
- But missing from EDIT modal ❌

### **Solution: ADDED!** ✅
```
Edit Recurring Expense Modal:
✅ Weekly
✅ Bi-weekly (Every 2 Weeks) ← ADDED!
✅ Monthly
✅ Yearly

Plus:
✅ Day-of-week selector (for weekly/bi-weekly)
✅ Helpful hint: "Perfect for paychecks!"
✅ Same UX as add modal
```

### **Now Users Can:**
- Edit existing recurring items
- Change to bi-weekly
- Select day of week
- Complete bi-weekly feature!

## 💎 **FIX #3: FINANCIAL GOALS CARD LOADING**

### **Problem:**
- Financial Goals card stuck on "Loading..."
- Data not passing to card

### **Root Cause:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
const baseData = {
  ...data,
  income: calculatedData.income,
  expenses: calculatedData.expenses,
  // ... goals missing!
};

// Goals card received: undefined ❌
```

### **Solution: FIXED!** ✅
```javascript
// AFTER (working):
const baseData = {
  ...data,
  income: calculatedData.income,
  expenses: calculatedData.expenses,
  // 🔧 FIX: Ensure goals are included
  goals: data.goals || []
};

// Goals card now receives: data.goals ✅
```

### **Now Users See:**
- ✅ Goals card loads properly
- ✅ Shows all goals (0/3 for free, unlimited for paid)
- ✅ Progress bars work
- ✅ Edit button works
