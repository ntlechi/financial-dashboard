## ‚úÖ All Improvements Completed

### 1. Mobile Modal UX Fix (CRITICAL!)
**Issue:** Upgrade modals too tall on mobile, close button off-screen

**Fix:** Sticky header, scrollable content, close button always visible  
**Files:** `src/components/UpgradePrompt.js`, `src/components/PricingModal.js`  
**Commit:** `51255bdc`

---

### 2. Trip Expense Dates Display
**Issue:** Dates were input but not shown on trip cards  
**Impact:** Users couldn't see when expenses occurred  
**Fix:** Added date display below expense description (matches side hustle UX)  
**Files:** `src/App.js`  
**Commit:** `8c8eb30f`

---

### 3. Calculation Audit & Critical Bug Fix
**Issue:** Business expenses NOT included in total expenses  
**Impact:** Cash flow overstated, savings rate inflated, wrong financial decisions  
**Fix:** Include `totalBusinessExpenses` in total expenses calculation  
**Files:** `src/App.js`  
**Commit:** `dc46260e`  

**Example:**
- User has $2k business income + $1.5k business expenses
- **BEFORE:** Total expenses = $3k (transactions only) ‚ùå
- **AFTER:** Total expenses = $4.5k (transactions + business) ‚úÖ

---

### 4. Sample Data Phantom Businesses Removed
**Issue:** FREE tier had businesses in sample data but couldn't access Side Hustle tab  
**Impact:** $40k phantom income + $6k phantom expenses  
**Fix:** Set `businesses: []` in initialData  
**Files:** `src/App.js`  
**Commit:** `f1eb335d`

---

### 5. Reset Data Button Fixed
**Issue:** Button didn't work (wrong Firebase path)  
**Impact:** Users couldn't reset their data  
**Fix:** Corrected path from `artifacts/.../` to `users/.../`  
**Files:** `src/App.js`  
**Commit:** `27a654c2`

---

### 6. Realistic Beginner Sample Data

**Impact:** Intimidating for beginners

### 7. Travel Trips Removed from Sample

**Impact:** FREE tier had phantom $85k travel savings  
**Fix:** Set `trips: []` in initialData  
**Files:** `src/App.js`  
**Commit:** `f93fd86b`

---

### 8. Monthly History Updated
**Issue:** Historical data had old unrealistic values  
**Impact:** Inconsistent with new beginner sample data
