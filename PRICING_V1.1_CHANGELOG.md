## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Feature Gating Updates (`src/utils/subscriptionUtils.js`)

**New Constants:**
```javascript
export const SIDE_HUSTLE_LIMITS = {
  [SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.FREE]: 0,
  [SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.CLIMBER]: 1,      // ⬅️ NEW: Climber gets 1
  [SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.OPERATOR]: Infinity,
  [SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.FOUNDERS_CIRCLE]: Infinity
};
```

**New Helper Functions:**
- `getSideHustleLimit(userTier)` - Returns max side hustles allowed
- `canAddSideHustle(userTier, currentCount)` - Checks if user can add more

**Updated Feature Access:**
```javascript
'side-hustle-limited': [CLIMBER, OPERATOR, FOUNDERS_CIRCLE],
'side-hustle-unlimited': [OPERATOR, FOUNDERS_CIRCLE],
```

---

### 2. Pricing Modal Updates (`src/components/PricingModal.js`)

**Firebase Integration:**
- Loads Founder's Circle subscriber count from `app-config/founders-circle` document
- Real-time countdown timer for launch window
- Dynamic "spots remaining" display

**UI Changes:**
- Climber Plan: Shows "Side Hustle Management (Limited to 1)"
- Operator Plan: Shows "Unlimited Side Hustle Management"
- All paid plans: Display "30-Day Money-Back Guarantee"

---

### 3. Webhook Updates (`api/stripe-webhook.js`)

**Founder's Circle Counter:**
```javascript
async function incrementFoundersCircleCount() {
  const countRef = db.collection('app-config').doc('founders-circle');
  await countRef.set({
    subscriberCount: admin.firestore.FieldValue.increment(1),
    lastUpdated: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
  }, { merge: true });
}
```

**Trigger:** Automatically called when a user subscribes to `founders-circle` plan

---

### 4. Subscription Loading (`src/App.js`)

**Fixed Critical Bugs:**
1. ✅ App now loads subscription data from Firebase `users/{uid}` collection
2. ✅ Badge displays correct tier: Recon / Climber / Operator / Founder
3. ✅ Console logs: "✅ Active subscription found: climber"

---
