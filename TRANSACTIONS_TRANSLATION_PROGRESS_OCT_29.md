## 🎯 WHAT'S REMAINING

### **High Priority:**

1. **TransactionModal.js Component**
   - This is a separate file (`src/components/TransactionModal.js`)
   - Needs full translation (modal title, labels, placeholders, tips)
   - ~15-20 more keys needed

2. **Subcategory Display Translation**
   - Currently shows English values like "housing", "food"
   - Need to add translation function for category displays
   - Already have keys in `categories` section

3. **Automation Preview Details**
   - The dynamic text: "This X will automatically be added every..."
   - Currently partially in English
   - Need to restructure the sentence for proper French

### **Lower Priority:**

4. **Transaction List Rendering**
   - If transactions are displayed in a list/table
   - Headers, empty states, action buttons

5. **Advanced Filters** (if visible)
   - Search placeholder
   - Filter type labels
   - Date range labels

---

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

1. **`src/App.js`**
   - Added `const { t } = useTranslation();` to TransactionsTab
   - Replaced ~50 hardcoded English strings
   - All major visible text now uses `t()` calls

2. **`src/locales/fr.json`**
   - Added 78 new translation keys
   - 4 new sections (transactions, frequencies, daysOfWeek, months)
   - Enhanced categories section
   - All with proper French accents (é, è, à, ô, etc.)

---

## 🚧 CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED

### **1. Dynamic Sentence Construction**
**Issue:** French word order differs from English  
**Example:** "This expense will automatically be added every week"  
**French:** "Cette dépense sera automatiquement ajoutée chaque semaine"

**Solution Needed:** 
- Restructure automation preview text
- Use template strings properly
- Consider gender agreement (Ce revenu/Cette dépense)

### **2. Pluralization**
**Issue:** French has different pluralization rules  
**Implemented:** Using `_plural` suffix for counts  
**Example:** 
```json
"active": "actif",
"active_plural": "actifs"
```

### **3. Category Display**
**Issue:** Subcategories stored in English (database values)  
**Observation:** Need translation lookup when displaying  
**Solution:** Add helper function to translate category keys

---

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### **1. Component Organization**
The Transactions page has TWO main components:
- `TransactionsTab` in App.js (main page)
- `TransactionModal.js` (separate file for add/edit)

Both need translation!

### **2. Reuse Common Keys**
Many labels are shared across pages:
- `common.amount`, `common.description`, `common.type`
- Saves translation keys and ensures consistency

### **3. Pluralization is Critical**
French pluralization is different:
- "1 actif" vs "2 actifs"
- "1 transaction" vs "2 transactions"
- Always add `_plural` suffix

### **4. Date/Time Formats**
Currently using `toLocaleDateString()` which auto-adapts
- Should specify 'fr-FR' locale explicitly for consistency
