Hi [Host],

Quick pitch: I built a financial education app that normally

Why your audience would care:

- AI-assisted development (new playbook for entrepreneurs)
- 15 years going from broke → 47 countries (credibility)
- FREE tier that rivals $99/year apps (disrupting the market)
- Building in public with transparent metrics

Unique angles:
1. How AI democratizes app development
2. Why the free tier is SO good (business strategy)
3. The financial education crisis (social impact)
4. Solo founder vs agency ($1K vs $400K)

5-day post-launch: [X] users, $[Y] MRR

Happy to share raw numbers and lessons learned.

Would this fit [Podcast Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]
