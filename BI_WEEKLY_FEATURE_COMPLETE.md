## 🧮 **THE CALCULATION LOGIC:**

### **How Bi-Weekly Works:**
```javascript
// For bi-weekly on Thursday starting Oct 10:
Start: Thursday, Oct 10
Next: Thursday, Oct 24 (14 days later)
Next: Thursday, Nov 7 (14 days later)
Next: Thursday, Nov 21 (14 days later)

Formula:
1. Find next occurrence of target day (Thursday)
2. Add 7 days (skip 1 week)
3. Result: 14 days total (bi-weekly!)
```

### **How Weekly Works:**
```javascript
// For weekly on Monday:
Next: Next Monday (7 days from last)
Then: Following Monday (7 days)
And so on...

Formula:
1. Find next occurrence of target day
2. Done!
```
