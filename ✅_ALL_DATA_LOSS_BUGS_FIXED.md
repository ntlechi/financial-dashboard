## 🎯 REMAINING setDoc CALLS (All Safe!)

### **1. Feedback Submission** (Line 11224)
```javascript
await setDoc(doc(db, 'feedback', `${Date.now()}_${user?.uid}`), feedbackDoc);
```
✅ **OK** - Creating NEW feedback document (not updating user data)

### **2. Reset Data** (Line 12462)
```javascript
await setDoc(doc(db, `users/${userId}/financials`, 'data'), resetData);
```
✅ **OK** - Intentional full replacement (user explicitly wants to reset)

### **3. Reset XP Profile** (Line 12474)
```javascript
await setDoc(doc(db, 'userProfiles', userId), initialProfile);
```
✅ **OK** - Intentional reset of XP (part of full reset)

### **4. Import Data** (Line 12625)
```javascript
await setDoc(doc(db, `users/${userId}/financials`, 'data'), importedData);
```
✅ **OK** - Intentional full replacement (user explicitly importing)

---

## 🛡️ THE FIX PATTERN

### **Before (DANGEROUS):**
```javascript
const updatedData = { ...data, someField: value };
await setDoc(doc(db, path), updatedData);
// 💥 If data is missing ANY field, it gets DELETED!
```

### **After (SAFE):**
```javascript
await updateDoc(doc(db, path), {
  someField: value
});
setData({ ...data, someField: value });
// ✅ Only updates specified field, ALL other data preserved!
```
