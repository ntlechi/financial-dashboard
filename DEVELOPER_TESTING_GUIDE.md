```
✅ Test Steps:
1. Add some financial data (income, expenses, goals)
2. Navigate between different tabs
3. Refresh the browser page
4. Close and reopen browser
5. Data should persist across all actions

✅ Expected Results:
- All data saves automatically
- No data loss on refresh
- Firebase console shows data in production database
```

#### **1.3 Core Financial Calculations**
```
✅ Test Scenarios:
1. Net Worth Calculation:

### **🛡️ PHASE 2: Error Boundary Testing**

#### **2.1 Test Error Boundaries Work**
```
✅ Intentional Error Tests:
1. Enter invalid data in calculators:
   - Negative interest rates
   - Zero or negative payments
   - Extremely large numbers
   - Non-numeric values

2. Try edge cases:
   - Empty form submissions
   - Special characters in number fields
   - Copy/paste invalid data

✅ Expected Results:
- Error boundaries catch errors gracefully
- User sees friendly error message
- App doesn't crash or show white screen
- Other components continue working
- Retry functionality works
```

#### **2.2 Network Error Testing**
```
✅ Test Steps:
1. Open browser dev tools → Network tab
2. Set network to "Offline"
3. Try to save data
4. Set back to "Online"
5. Verify data syncs

✅ Expected Results:
- Graceful handling of network issues
- Data saves when connection restored
- No app crashes from network errors
```

### **⚡ PHASE 4: Performance Testing**

#### **4.1 Loading Speed Testing**
```
✅ Performance Metrics:
1. Open browser dev tools → Lighthouse
2. Run performance audit
3. Target scores:
   - Performance: >90
   - Accessibility: >90
   - Best Practices: >90
   - SEO: >80

✅ Manual Speed Tests:
- Initial page load: <3 seconds
- Tab switching: <1 second
- Data saving: <2 seconds
- Chart rendering: <2 seconds
```

#### **4.2 Bundle Size Verification**
```
✅ Check Build Output:
npm run build

✅ Expected Results:
- Main JS: <230 kB gzipped
- CSS: <10 kB gzipped
- No console warnings
- Clean production build
```

---

### **🔒 PHASE 5: Security Testing**

#### **5.1 Firebase Security Testing**
```
✅ Security Verification:
1. Open browser console
2. Try to access other users' data
3. Attempt unauthorized database operations
4. Verify HTTPS is enforced
5. Check no sensitive data in console

✅ Expected Results:
- Firestore rules block unauthorized access
- Only own user data accessible
- All connections over HTTPS
- No API keys or secrets exposed
```

#### **5.2 Environment Variable Testing**
```
✅ Production Environment Check:
1. Open browser dev tools → Console
2. Run: console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV)
3. Should show: "production"
4. Verify no dev/test data mixed in
```

## 🔧 **Developer Testing Tools**

### **Built-in Browser Tools:**
```
✅ Chrome DevTools:
- Console: Check for errors
- Network: Monitor API calls
- Application: Check localStorage/Firebase
- Lighthouse: Performance audit

# After deployment
curl -I https://app.survivebackpacking.com  # Check HTTPS
```

### **Browser Console Tests:**
```javascript
// Run this in browser console at app.survivebackpacking.com

// 1. Environment check
console.log('Environment:', process.env.NODE_ENV);

// 2. Performance check
console.log('Load time:', performance.timing.loadEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart, 'ms');

// 3. Firebase connection check
console.log('Firebase connected:', !!window.firebase);

// 4. Error boundary test
// Try entering invalid data to trigger error boundaries
```
