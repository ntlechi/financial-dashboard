🔐 QUICK INSTRUCTION: Add Forgot Password Button
================================================

STEP 1: Open src/App.js

STEP 2: Find line ~13457 (search for: onChange={(e) => setAuthForm({...authForm, password: e.target.value})}

STEP 3: After the password input's closing />, add this code:

                
                {/* Forgot Password Link */}
                {authMode === 'login' && (
                  <div className="text-right -mt-2 mb-2">
                    <button
                      type="button"
                      onClick={() => setShowForgotPassword(true)}
                      className="text-sm text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline transition-colors"
                    >
                      Forgot Password?
                    </button>
                  </div>
                )}

STEP 4: Save and test!

That's it! The modal is already set up and working. You just need to add the button that opens it.

✅ Everything else is already deployed:
   - ForgotPassword component ✅
   - Modal rendering ✅
   - Welcome emails ✅
   - Temporary passwords ✅
   - Firebase password reset ✅

🎯 Just add the button and you're done!
