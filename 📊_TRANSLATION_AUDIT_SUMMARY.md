## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

Given the massive scope (150+ strings!), I recommend we tackle this in **phases**:

### **PHASE 1: CRITICAL (P0) - ~60 strings**
1. Auth/Login page placeholders (first impression!)
2. Transactions page (highest traffic)
3. Investment page (premium feature)
4. Budget Calculator (core feature)

**Impact:** Fixes 70% of user-visible English bleeding  
**Time:** 1-2 hours  

### **PHASE 2: HIGH (P1) - ~50 strings**
1. Side Hustle page
2. Travel page
3. Moments page
4. Settings/Modals

**Impact:** Fixes remaining 25% of issues  
**Time:** 1 hour  

### **PHASE 3: POLISH (P2) - ~40 strings**
1. Tooltip text
2. Aria labels
3. Less-visible hints
4. Edge case empty states

**Impact:** Final 5% polish  
**Time:** 30 minutes

## 💰 TRANSLATION KEYS TO ADD:

I've identified that we need to add approximately:
- **150+ new English keys**
- **150+ new French translations**
- **150+ new Spanish translations**

**Total:** ~450 new translation entries!

**File Size Impact:**
- `en.json`: 492 lines → ~650 lines (+32%)
- `fr.json`: 855 lines → ~1,000 lines (+17%)
- `es.json`: 751 lines → ~900 lines (+20%)

This will fix:
✅ Auth/Login (first impression!)  
✅ Transactions (highest traffic)

✅ Budget Calculator (core feature)  

**That's ~60 strings that cover 70% of user-visible English bleeding!**
