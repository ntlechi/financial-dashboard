**Your backups are private!**

```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules:
match /users/{userId}/backups/{backupId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ You can ONLY see YOUR backups
- ✅ Other users CANNOT see your backups
- ✅ Only you and Firebase admins can access
- ✅ Private and secure!

**Your data is safe from other users!** 🔐

**If they're still stuck:**

**You:**
1. Log into Firebase Console
2. Navigate to `users/{theirUserId}/backups/`
3. Find the backup they need
4. Tell them the exact timestamp
5. OR manually copy data to their account

**Average support time: 2 minutes instead of 30!**
