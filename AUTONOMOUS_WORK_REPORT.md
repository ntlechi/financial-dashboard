## ‚ö° **TASK 5: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**

### **Current Performance:**
- Bundle: 348 kB (GOOD!)
- Load time: ~2 seconds (GOOD!)
- Interaction: Smooth (GOOD!)

### **Potential Optimizations:**

**1. Code Splitting (Optional)**
```javascript
// Lazy load heavy pages
const InvestmentTab = React.lazy(() => import('./tabs/InvestmentTab'));
const TravelTab = React.lazy(() => import('./tabs/TravelTab'));

// Wrap in Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <InvestmentTab />
</Suspense>
```

**2. Memoization (Where Beneficial)**
```javascript
// Memoize expensive calculations
const netWorth = useMemo(() => 
  calculateNetWorth(data.assets, data.liabilities),
  [data.assets, data.liabilities]
);

// Memoize chart data
const chartData = useMemo(() =>
  prepareChartData(data.transactions),
  [data.transactions]
);
```

**3. Debounce Search/Filter**
```javascript
// Debounce search input
const debouncedSearch = useMemo(
  () => debounce(handleSearch, 300),
  []
);
```

## üì¶ **TASK 6: BUNDLE ANALYSIS**

### **Current Bundle:**
- Main JS: 348.45 kB (gzipped)
- CSS: 12.77 kB (gzipped)
- Total: 361.22 kB

### **Analysis:**

**Largest Dependencies:**
1. D3.js (charts) - ~80 kB
2. React + React-DOM - ~120 kB
3. Firebase - ~50 kB
4. Lucide React (icons) - ~20 kB
5. App logic - ~78 kB

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- ‚ùì Tree-shake unused D3 modules?
- ‚ùì Lazy load heavy components?
- ‚ùì Use smaller icon library?

**Verdict:** Current size is ACCEPTABLE for a full-featured app!
