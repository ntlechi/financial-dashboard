## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Google Analytics Measurement ID

### **What Needs to Be Done:**

The app is **fully configured** for Google Analytics 4, but I cannot access your analytics.google.com account to retrieve the Measurement ID.

**You need to:**

1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Create/select your GA4 property
3. Get your Measurement ID (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
4. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` in `public/index.html`:
   - Line 23: In the script src URL
   - Line 30: In the gtag config
5. Deploy the change

**Detailed instructions:** See `GA4_QUICK_SETUP.md`

**Time required:** ~5 minutes

## 🧪 RECOMMENDED TESTING

Before October 19th launch, test these critical flows:

### **User Journey Testing:**

- [ ] Submit feature request → Check Firebase `feedback` collection

### **Mobile Testing:**
