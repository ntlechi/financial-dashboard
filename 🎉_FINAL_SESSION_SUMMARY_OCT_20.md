## 💡 RESPONSES TO COMMON INVESTOR QUESTIONS

### **Q: "How do you compare to Mint?"**
> "Mint is great for tracking, but it's passive. We add gamification to make financial planning active and fun. Plus, we're mobile-first PWA - no app store delays."

### **Q: "What's your moat?"**
> "Three things: 1) Gamification creates habit formation and retention 2) Travel integration serves digital nomads - underserved market 3) PWA technology means faster iteration than competitors stuck in app store approval cycles."

### **Q: "How will you acquire users?"**
> "Freemium model for viral growth. Content marketing to travel/FIRE communities. SEO for 'financial freedom calculator' 'budget app for travelers'. Conversion rate of 2-5% to paid = sustainable CAC."

### **Q: "What's your revenue model?"**
> "SaaS subscription: $25-$75/month. Conservative estimate: 10K users = $1.5M ARR. With 72M millennials in US, even 0.5% penetration = $18M ARR."

### **Q: "Technical risks?"**
> "We're on proven infrastructure - Firebase, Vercel, Stripe. All enterprise-grade. Biggest technical risk is scaling, which we solve by being serverless. We auto-scale to millions of users."

### **Q: "What do you need funding for?"**
> "Three priorities: 1) Marketing to reach first 10K users 2) Bank integration (Plaid API) 3) Small team (1-2 developers). This accelerates us to $1M ARR in 12 months."
