**Status:** 🔍 IN PROGRESS

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive audit of all financial calculations across the entire application to ensure accuracy and logical consistency.

## 🎯 Core Calculation Functions

### 1. `calculateIncomeExpenses()` (Line 7194-7272)
**Purpose:** Main calculation engine for income and expenses from transactions + businesses

**Logic:**
```javascript
// Income Calculation:
totalTransactionIncome = SUM(transactions where type='income')
totalBusinessIncome = SUM(businesses.totalIncome)
totalIncome = totalTransactionIncome + totalBusinessIncome

// Expense Calculation:
totalExpenses = SUM(transactions where type='expense')

// Grouping:
- Groups income by subcategory
- Adds business income as separate categories
- Groups expenses by subcategory
```

**✅ Issues Found:**
- ✅ Uses `Math.abs()` correctly for amounts
- ✅ Handles empty transactions array
- ✅ Combines transaction income + business income
- ⚠️ **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** Business expenses NOT included in total expenses!

---

### 2. `getDisplayData()` (Line 7310-7352)
**Purpose:** Prepares display data with all calculations for dashboard cards

**Key Calculations:**
```javascript
// 1. Income & Expenses: FROM calculateIncomeExpenses()
income.total = calculated from transactions + businesses
expenses.total = calculated from transactions only

// 2. Cash Flow:
cashflow.total = income.total - expenses.total
cashflow.monthly = income.total - expenses.total

// 3. Savings Rate:
savingsRate.current = ((income - expenses) / income) * 100
ROUNDED to 2 decimals

// 4. Net Worth:
- Dynamically updates Investments value from holdings
- Recalculates total: SUM(breakdown.value)

// 5. Investment Total:
totalValue = SUM(holdings.totalValue)
```

**✅ Issues Found:**
- ✅ Cash flow calculation correct
- ✅ Savings rate formula correct (with division by zero check)
- ✅ Net worth recalculates dynamically
- ⚠️ **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** Business expenses not factored into cash flow!

---

### 3. `getAnnualizedData()` (Line 7275-7303)
**Purpose:** Convert monthly data to annual for annual view mode

**Logic:**
```javascript
income.total = monthly * 12
expenses.total = monthly * 12
cashflow.total = monthly * 12
// Savings rate stays the same (percentage)
```

**✅ Issues Found:**
- ✅ Multiplies by 12 correctly
- ✅ Savings rate percentage unchanged (correct!)

## 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 🚨 Issue #1: Business Expenses Not Included in Total Expenses
**Location:** `calculateIncomeExpenses()` (Line 7194-7272)

**Problem:**
- Income includes BOTH transaction income AND business income ✅
- Expenses include ONLY transaction expenses ❌
- Business expenses (`business.totalExpenses`) are NOT included!

**Impact:**
- **Cash Flow** is OVERSTATED (missing business costs)
- **Savings Rate** is OVERSTATED (expenses too low)
- **Expenses Card** doesn't show full picture

**Example:**
```
User has:
- Transaction income: $5,000
- Business income: $2,000
- Transaction expenses: $3,000
- Business expenses: $1,500

CURRENT CALCULATION:
Total Income: $7,000 ✅ CORRECT
Total Expenses: $3,000 ❌ WRONG (missing $1,500)
Cash Flow: $4,000 ❌ WRONG (should be $2,500)
Savings Rate: 57% ❌ WRONG (should be 36%)
```

## 🛠️ RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Fix #1: Include Business Expenses in Total Expenses

**File:** `src/App.js`  
**Function:** `calculateIncomeExpenses()`  
**Line:** ~7204-7206

**CHANGE FROM:**
```javascript
const totalExpenses = transactions
  .filter(t => t.type === 'expense')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + Math.abs(t.amount), 0);
```

**CHANGE TO:**
```javascript
// Calculate transaction expenses
const totalTransactionExpenses = transactions
  .filter(t => t.type === 'expense')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + Math.abs(t.amount), 0);

// Calculate business expenses
const totalBusinessExpenses = businesses.reduce((sum, business) => 
  sum + (business.totalExpenses || business.expenses || 0), 0);

// Combine transaction and business expenses
const totalExpenses = totalTransactionExpenses + totalBusinessExpenses;
```

**Also update expense categorization to include business expenses:**
```javascript
// Add business expenses as separate categories
businesses.forEach((business, index) => {
  if (business.totalExpenses > 0) {
    const businessKey = `${business.name || `Business ${index + 1}`} Expenses`;
    expensesByCategory[businessKey] = business.totalExpenses;
  }
});
```
